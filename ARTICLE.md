This is an interesting research paper I found about Multi-Modal-RAG. Really relevant for context retrieval from multiple sources.

[Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20734)

This paper describes a retrieval‑augmented generation approach that combines multiple modalities into the retrieval and generation pipeline. It is interesting because it introduces cross‑modal indexing and scoring, allowing systems to fetch and combine relevant documents from different sources before generating responses.

Practical relevance for software engineering includes improved code and documentation search, and designs for integrating multimodal context into existing RAG systems.

I found this paper interesting because it shows how RAG systems can work across different data types, not just text. The idea of cross-modal retrieval feels very relevant for real software systems, especially for searching across code,
documentation, and other technical resources.
